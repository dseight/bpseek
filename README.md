# bpseek

Bruteforce pattern seeking.

This is a small tool to search for repeating patterns in a binary files.

It is using a bruteforce algorithm that is trying all possible sizes of the
pattern, and choosing the one with the _mimimal Hamming weight per total bits_
ratio.

At the moment it is stupid and unreliable. Don't use it. Strictly WIP.
